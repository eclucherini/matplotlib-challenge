# matplotlib-challenge

Note: My Jupyter notebook with the finished code is located in the folder Pymaceuticals and titled "main.ipynb". 

I was able to use most of what we learned in class to do this challenge. I did run into problems in using dataframes to create the different charts, but as always, StackOverflow and Geeks for Geeks were incredibly helpful.

I found that using pyplot to create graphs and charts was easier than using pandas, but that's just my personal preference.
